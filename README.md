Embedded Systems projectÂ to create a portable card scanner device using leftover HID II Proxy scanners

This project builds upon the work done at:
  * [https://obviate.io/2016/11/23/connecting-a-hid-prox-pro-ii-rfid-reader-to-arduino/](https://obviate.io/2016/11/23/connecting-a-hid-prox-pro-ii-rfid-reader-to-arduino/)
  * [https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-data-logger-shield](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-data-logger-shield)
  * And requires the RTClib library (can be installed through the Arduino Lib Manager)

The idea is to combine previous work and hardware built in the Smart Lab to make a portable card scanner for attendance and other places and times when you need to track attendance.
